                It's not an exaggeration to say that Laravel has <i>changed my life</i>.
                I appreciate your encouragement to contribute to and support open source work, as well as
                your dedication to work-life balance, and family/mental health.
                I admire how you hold yourselves accountable for maintaining diversity in the workplace,
                your respect of other cultures, and just general social responsibility.
                <b>Laravel has some of the most impressive minds</b>; like Jess, Tim, and Joe,
                and I would absolutely love to have the opportunity to learn from them.
                I love the sense of community that radiates outward in every direction from your company.
                I would be exceedingly proud to say to someone at a conference I'm attending:
                "<u style="text-decoration-color: LightCoral;">I work at Laravel</u>."
