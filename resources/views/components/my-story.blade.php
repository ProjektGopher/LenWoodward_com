      was my primary source of income for 15 years. My programming journey there started predictably enough: simply
      creating and maintaining a marketing website for a family run construction company using HTML and CSS. After
      several iterations over the years, I eventually rebuilt the site using Wordpress, as many do. As the needs of
      the company grew, so did my skills. I learned PHP, MySQL, and JS; I also discovered Laravel. Over time, Laravel
      became the backbone of a custom CRM I built for the company. PenHome ultimately closed shortly after Covid.

      has been the umbrella under which I've constantly written code for personal projects, and for freelance projects, 
      since that very first calculator program I wrote in VB over {{ now()->format('Y') - 2003 }} years ago. It became my
      full-time job in 2021, and it's been exceedingly fulfilling. I work exclusively in the web, and am always staying
      up&#x2011;to&#x2011;date with current trends as well as new and interesting technologies.

      is a brand new partnership born out of a highly compatible working relationship with a friend and colleague from
      a client project. Together we're building a small suite of narrowly targeted tools for Laravel developers, as
      well as co-founding some interesting projects with outside partners who are better at marketing than we are.
      We're both excited to see where this new venture takes us. We also have a podcast, and a
